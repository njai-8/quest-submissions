#### 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars
The 5 Pillars are - Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience and Resource Oriented Programming.

#### Why are the 5 Pillars useful
The 5 Pillars of Cadence are useful because it ensures the efficiency and quality the whole blockchain as it is the Programming Language for the Smart Contract on the Flow blockchain.

1. Safety and Security - It is obvious that safety and security is very important to a blockchain as a lot of the transaction on it consist of the trading of valuable assets like cryptocurrency or NFTs. As the Programming Language for the Smart Contracts on Flow blockchain, if the Safety and Security can be ensured it will mean the trading on it to be a lot more secure and users will have more confidence.

2. Clarity - The clarity of a Programming Language is important as it would benefits in a few ways. First, developers can put together code that is less prone to bugs. Second, it is easier for the users to read the smart contracts to verify before they sign. This again will improve people's confidence on the blockchain.

3. Approachability - The structure of Cadence code is very similar to many popular programming language. This could attract more developers into coding cadence and bring up the quality of the codes, as well as making the Flow blockchain more popular.

4. Developer Experience - Similar to the above pillar, the better developer experience would attract more developers into cadence as this makes their job easier. Experience developers who used other language will feel at home if the transition is smooth. This again, will result in good quality codes and in turn, make the Flow blockchain more popular.
