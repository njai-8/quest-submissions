1. What is Blockchain
Essentially, blockchain is a shared database that is decentralized, and in decentralized it means that everyone can access it in some ways.
The name blockchain comes from the fact that it consists of ‘blocks’ of data that are ‘chained’ together. Each block has a timestamp that cannot be changed thus the sequence can be traced.The data that was written into the blockchain cannot be reversed and will be there as long as the blockchain exists. 

2. What is a Smart Contract
A Smart Contract is a program on the blockchain. It can be triggered by specific events and take inputs and add to the blockchain if certain conditions are met.

3. Difference between scripts and transactions
First, a Script does not cost anything to run while a Transaction costs a certain amount of fee depending on which blockchain it runs on. Secondly, Scripts are for viewing data that is already on the blockchain, while Transactions are being used to add data to the blockchain.
